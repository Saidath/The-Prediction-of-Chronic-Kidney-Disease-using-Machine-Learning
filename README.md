# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on various medical parameters. The web application allows users to input medical data and receive a prediction about the likelihood of CKD.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting various medical parameters.
- Machine learning model to predict the likelihood of CKD.
- Results displayed after form submission.
- Built with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.
- Bootstrap-based styling for a clean and responsive UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  
- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python web framework)
  - Machine Learning (for CKD prediction)
  
- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - You can train the machine learning model using your dataset and integrate it with the Flask app.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
